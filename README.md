# BullsAndCowsGame
This is a game where the user guesses a randomly generated code (only 3, 4, or 5 digits long). Each number is unique. When the user inputs their guess, they get in return the number of bulls and cows within their answer. A cow means one of the numbers are correct, but it is in the wrong spot. A bull means one of the numbers is present in the code and is in the correct spot.
